# Optical Transitions in Quasi-Two-Dimensional Nanostructures
This repository contains files used for my bachelors semiconductor research.

• Investigated energy spectrum of particle and wave equations in asymmetrical parabolic potential well.
• Using finite element method found energy levels of two wells and their wave equations.
• Using dipole approximation, calculated dependence of probability of transition from second energy level to first on effective mass, on length of well & barrier thickness.
