# I-N-I-P-I-N-I
A repo of my semiconductor research

• Investigated energy spectrum of particle and wave equations in asymmetrical parabolic potential well.
• Using finite element method found energy levels of two wells and their wave equations.
• Using dipole approximation, calculated dependence of probability of transition from second energy level to first on effective mass, on length of well & barrier thickness.
